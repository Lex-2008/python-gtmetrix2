Examples of python-gtmetrix2 usage
==================================

In order for this examples to work, you must:

* have a [GTmetrix API][] key

* have the python-gtmetrix2 module installed

For your convenience, there is a _symlink_ in this directory,
which effectively emulates the second installation way
(the "file copy" one).

But you still need API key.
