   :start-after: Simplest example:
   :end-before: For a wordy introduction

All the following examples are available in the `github repo in "examples"
subdir <https://github.com/Lex-2008/python-gtmetrix2/tree/main/examples>`__

On this page, only the most interesting part is shown - without ``include``
statements and ``if __name__ == "__main__"`` part which makes them into
executable scripts.
